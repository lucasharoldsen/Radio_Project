Radio_Project
=============

This project is making additional accessory to portable radio

We created accessories for a portable radio which already has many functions such as hand crank generator, solar cells, radio, flash light, USB 5V out, and mini USB, and audio jack. 
This project was our attempt to address culture of over accessorized and multifunctional electronics. We used USB connection as starting point of exploration of accessory because of its ubiquity. 
We created utensils to expand functionality but turn radio into accessory, and digger shovel and hard hat for comical simulation for large construction machinery operation changing context to radio into toy. 
Function of radio changes in relation to sets of accessories. personalization.
